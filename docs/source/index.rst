demosys-py
==========

A python 3 implementation of a C++ project used to create and
prototype demos (see
`demoscene <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene>`__) in OpenGL. The
design of this version is heavily inspired by the
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ project.

This is a cross platform project that should work on OS X, Linux and Windows.

This was originally made for for non-interactive real time graphics
combined with music ("real time music videos"). It's made for people who
enjoy playing around with modern OpenGL without having to spend lots of
time creating all the tooling to get things up and running.
